    "Moodipy is a chatbot that allows you to either chat about or get a song recommendation based on your feelings. If you wanted to *give* a song recommendation instead of receiving one, the bot allows for that option as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbot was initially created based on the idea that music is a universal language that anyone can enjoy and relate to. Regardless of what your mood is, whether you are happy, sad, or just bored, there is a suitable song out there for you! I enjoy finding new music for myself and my loved ones, and thought it would be a fun project to convey that interest through a chatbot. \n",
